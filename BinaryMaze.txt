BINARY MAZE CHALLENGE:
• INITIAL BINARY STATE:
You start with a binary number: 1100101011110010
• LOGICAL GATES ROOM:
AND gate with 1010110010101101 :
1000100010100000
OR gate with 0111001100110011:
1111101110110011
XOR gate with 1101110111001110:
0010011001111101
NOT gate applied to the result of the previous XOR operation:
1101100110000010
• BINARY CONVERSION ROOM:
Binary to decimal: 1101100110000010 = 55810
Add 123: 55810 + 123 = 55933
Multiply by 7: 55933 * 7 = 391531
: 391531 = 1100001111011101011 (CONVERSION BACK TO BINARY)
• WEIGHTED BINARY BALANCING:
We first divide into group of 4 elements, we weight the two groups. If balanced, the
heavier one is in the last group; otherwise, it's in the heavier group. Hence this
processes is continued till heaviest binary is found. The heaviest binary is 1111.
• BINARY TREE NAVIGATION:
Path: Root → 1 → 0 → 1 → 1 → 1
Steps must be validated for even counts of 1s
• BINARY PALINDROMES:
The binary number 1011011101 is not initially a palindrome. To transform it into a
palindrome, only one bit flip is required. By flipping the bit at position 4 from 0 to 1,
the number becomes 1011111101, which satisfies the condition of being a
palindrome.
• COMPLEX BINARY PATTERNS:
1111000000 → 960
1110100000 → 928
1110010000 → 896
1101100000 → 768
1011100000 → 704
We still have a lot such numbers. Here are a few
• Binary XOR Pairs with Constraints:
The pair of numbers that yields the maximum XOR value while adhering to the
condition of not having more than three consecutive '1's is:
(101010, 011011) in binary, which corresponds to (42, 27) in decimal.
Thus, the answer is:
Pair: (101010, 011011)
Maximum XOR Result: 63
• Binary Multiples and Remainders:
Convert to decimal: 106
106÷7=15.142857
106 mod 7=1
Hence is not a multiple of 7.
• Goal:
Final binary number after all steps: 1100001111011101011
Convert to decimal and multiply by 5:
Binary to decimal: 391531
Final result: 391531 * 5 = 1957655
Provide the final decimal number: 1957655
